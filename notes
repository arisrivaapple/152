maybe use button gorups instead of tiles for tasks???

big want: tiles thatshift a=shift around as you scale the window size

im kind of into the idea of using bootstrap "fluid" containers and putting them in a two-ayer container with the outside layer invisable to simiulate spacing

screenshot of style saved on to "tiles" and "tiles2"

 next: simple prize shuffle

 group ideas

 emoji roulette???
